Project Overview
This project aims to assess and project post-fire transitions and reburn dynamics in the western Cascades using the LANDIS-II landscape vegetation simulation model. It will evaluate how forest ecosystems respond to future climate changes and emerging land management strategies.

Objectives
Synthesize existing research on post-fire and post-reburn forest development.
Use LANDIS-II to project forest ecosystem responses to climate change and fire regimes.

Geographic Scope
The research covers the western Cascades, spanning parts of Washington and Oregon.
